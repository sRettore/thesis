# thesis

Code for my thesis, using MiB setup with incremental learning (with Maximum Square Loss).
Original github MiB: https://github.com/fcdl94/MiB
Original github MSQ: https://github.com/fcdl94/MiB

To run the code:
1) Download the Cityscapes and GTA datasets
2) Save them as CityScapesDataset and GTADataset in the data directory with an image directory for the samples and a label directory for the annotations
3) Download the pretrained model from the Maximum Square Loss Github and save it in the pretrained directory

4) Run the code following the script.bat example, parameters can be seen in the argparser.py file
